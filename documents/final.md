# Introduction

The domain that the language addresses is complex calendars. 
This would be for people that need a complex calendar design and don't
have the time and patients to hand add and remove events in their 
calendar of choice. An example user would  be 
a student who has two different semesters with different classes. 
Each class meets at the same time each week, but there are breaks
and holidays during which class doesn't meet. Finals week also has
a different schedule requiring a different set of events in a 
calendar. The act of making a calendar this complex kind of 
defeats the purpose of making a calendar in the first place, 
so calendarscript seeks to allow those calendar users the ability
to create a fit-all calendar for their complex lives. Since most
calendar programs have import capabilities for ical files, my DSL
outputs that. 

The three basic data structures that calendarscript contains are 
```Calendars, Sections``` and ```Events```. Calendars can contain 
Sections and Events, Sections can contain Sections and Events. 
Events are just definitions though. This basically allows users to
scope different events into several levels of sections. 

This is a good language in this domain because it has a high level
of user customizability. Since the ```includes``` and ```excludes```
are basically just Ands and Ors for times, their inclusion in the
logic of the language allows for very complex date range combinations.
Users that will be using calendarscript hopefully don't need to make
easy calendars, so the ammount of overhead required to create a single
calendar is well worth it for the intended audience. 

# Language Design

Users write the language as a simple code. The syntax is simple enough
that users should be able to see code from the sample program and copy
and paste it into their program, if they are not use to programming. 
There are basically 2-3 different types in the language, which makes it
rather easy to read and understand. By restricting the users to these
2 or 3 types, it should restrict the way they think about creating the
program. 

The computational model of this language is just a static set of date
definitions that are evaluated against each other. So the computation 
being ran is a static scan of events and each set of dates that it is
associated with. 

The three basic data structures that my DSL contains are ```Calendars, Sections``` and ```Events```. Calendars can contain Sections and Events, Sections can contain Sections and Events. Events are just definitions though. The Language looks like this

```
Calendar := name Dates Filler

Section := Dates Filler

Filler := Section | Event | Section Filler | Event Filler

Event := name Times EventComponents
```

The main way that users can manipulate these structures are through scoping 
different events with different dates. That is the main purpose of the language.
The DSL also contains user settings, but those are just defined as strings. 
Since this is a static language, there aren't really any control structures
in place. 

As mentioned before, the DSL takes in a file containing the text language and outputs an ical file that calendars import. The only
errors that can occur in this process is through incorrect syntax written by the user. Though since PackratParser was used,
syntax errors are nicely shown in the error output by the program. Currently, users using the website don't have an easy way
of seeing errors. They have to look in the file that is returned to them. 

The only other DSL for this domain is [ICal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar), which is a very hard to write file format. My DSL is more of a DSL for ICal though,
so I'm not sure if you can consider them in the same domain. 

# Example

## Input

Here is an sample calendar for my spring semester.

```
settings {
	time-format: "hh:mm a",
	date-format: "MM/dd/yyyy"
}

calendar school-calendar {

    section classes {

        dates {
            includes { 1/19/2016 - 5/4/2016 }
            excludes {  3/11/2016 - 3/20/2016,
                        3/25/2016 }
        }

        section mudd-classes {

            dates {
                excludes { 5/1/2016 - 5/4/2016 }
            }
            event algorithms {
                times { weekly( 11:00 am - 12:15 pm MO, WE, FR ) }
            }

            event interaction-design {
                times { weekly( 9:35 am - 10:50 am TU, TH) }
            }

            event macroeconomics {
                times { weekly( 2:45 pm - 4:00 pm MO, WE) }
            }

            event clinic {
                times { weekly( 11:00 am - 12:15 pm TU) }
            }

            event colloquium {
                times { weekly( 4:15 pm - 5:30 pm TH) }
            }
        }

        section other-5c-classes {

            event intro-to-acting {
                times { weekly(1:15 pm - 3:45 pm TU, TH) }
            }

            event squash {
                times { weekly(9:00 am - 9:45 am MO, WE) }
            }
        }
    }

    section finals {
        dates {
            includes { 5/9/2016 - 5/14/2016 }
        }

        event senior-finals {
            times { daily(8:00 am - 5:00 pm)}
        }
    }
}
```

# Language Implementation

The host language used for calendarscript is Scala. I chose Scala because the implementation of my language
was very similar our implementation of external piconot, so it made sense for me to work with the same 
host language. The DSL is an external DSL since users aren't expected to know any general purpose programming
language. 

## User Interaction (How one uses the program)

There are 3 different ways: 

#### From Website

The easiest way to run a calendarscript is to input it into [this web app](http://www.aputman.com/rcal).
After running it there, it will just save an ical file on your computer. 

#### From Jar

The 2nd easiest way to run this program is to [download the jar file](https://github.com/aputman/calendarscript/blob/master/RCal.jar?raw=true).

This requires Java, but after downloading, all you need to do is run

```java -jar RCal.java arg1 arg2```

with the 2 command line arguments being:

1. the file (including location) of the calendarscript file (```path\to\file.cal```)
2. the folder location that your resulting ical file will be saved (```path\to\folder\```)

#### From the source code

To run this program from the source, scala and sbt are currently required. Here are the steps 

1. Download and install scala and sbt. 
2. run ```sbt``` in the parent foler of this project.
3. run ```run arg1 arg2``` with the 2 command line arguments being:
  1. the file (including location) of the calendarscript file (```path\to\file.cal```)
  2. the folder location that your resulting ical file will be saved (```path\to\folder\```)

The name of the resulting file will be the name that you gave your calendar. 

# Evaluation

Overall, I would say that calendarscript (or RCal. I know, I should have picked one name by now) is very DSL-y. It doesn't allow for
general computation and doesn't even have line by line evaluation. It is just a new representation of data that can be compiled
by a computer. 

I am very pleased that I eventually got the language to be run from a website. I thought this was one of my most important goals 
when I sought to achieve a larger user base for the DSL. I am also pleased with the copy and pastability of the language. This allows
non programmers to still be able to mess with it. 

The one thing that I can thing of to be improved at this point is a less JSON like syntax. If the syntax seems accesible, people 
are more willing to give the DSL a shot. While some might think the implementation of Calendarscript is a bit verbose, I like that
feature of it. It has allowed to to easily test and add new features to the language. 

The main change I made after user testing wasn't really in the implementation of the DSL but more in the plans for how users would
use the DSL. I talked to many high frequency calendar users and many said they would be interested in the DSL. Every single one said
that they were unlikely to use it though if it wasn't as accessible to them as a website. Even a jar file was too much effort for 
most of them. That is why I put such a heavy focus on getting the website working this week. 

## Problems

I didn't really experience many problems when implementing my DSL. There were some non avoidable problems with the structure of 
ICalendar, but the fact that my language needed to be written proved that the case. Some features such as user settings took a bit
more host language manipulation but nothing really ever got stuck in its development. I could say I got lucky in this regard. I had
a strong vision for what I wanted, and was lucky that that vision wasn't too hard to achieve. 

# Planned Additional Features

- New, more leniant syntax
- Better error messages and debugging for the website
- Templating (at this point, I'm not even sure I know what this means)
