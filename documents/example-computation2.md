You need to make 6 groups of four from a pool of 50 people, not using everyone. Each of the 6 groups has a preassigned
topic and every member of the group needs to be interested in that topic and at least 2 of the members need to have
at least a year of experience working in that topic-area.

Each person will be inputted like so:

`A` is interested in `x,y,z` and has 1.5 years of experience in `x` and .75 years of experience in `z`. 

My program will return the groups with the maximum number of years of experience per group, all else being random.
