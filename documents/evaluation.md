# Preliminary evaluation
I can't believe I'm already writing an evaluation for this project, time really sneaks up on you! Overall I'm satisfied with the progression of my project but think I need to work on applying more directed focus to solving specific problems. I think I tend to get off track working on parts of the project that I want to work on instead of parts of the product that _need my attention at that moment_. I think this is pretty inherent to building something, its more fun to work on stuff that you can see rewards from instead of digging in deep with the hard problems, but I want to/need to improve on it.

I'm really pleased with the state of my parser and internal representation. I think its really neat and clean and _extensible_ which is key. I also have been really getting on rolls where I can rip off a chunk of code really successfully because of how comfortable I'm getting in python. So I guess things I'm really pleased with: 
  1. Parser
  2. Host Language/Framework choice
  3. Syntax design, I've pretty much gotten it to how I imagined it

I need to do my back end. There are a couple of questions (choices) that need to be answered before I can proceed but I'm working hard on answering them. _This really needs to be improved_. I also want to put some design thought into how I'm going to return the data, but its possible that the implementation could inform this decision so I'm waiting on this.

In terms of the evaluation tools I've used, I actually haven't used any of the evaluation tools that I planned on using. In retrospect most of those tools were for evaluation at the _end_ of the project not throughout which is a mistake. I have really been simply responding to problems that I've been having and work through the project in that way. I'm not sure if that means I'm being responsive rather than proactive but I don't really feel as though I have been.

I've run into trouble with the back end as I have previously mentioned. The constraint solvers I've found don't really fit with the domain that I need it to be. This is a tough problem because it only really has hacky solutions. Either I can try and put my data in a form usable with the constraint solvers (coding, pro: better solving con: time consuming) or build a constraint solver (doing my own logic, pro: faster, extensible con: will never be as smart as other constraint solvers).

I still have to do the backend. I know how it will work logically but I need to implement it still.
