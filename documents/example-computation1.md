## First Example

You need to make groups of three people, each group with one leader and one communications director. Each group will need to choose their own topic for the project.

`A` is interested in being the leader but not the communications and has interests in `m,n,o,p`. He wants to work with `D` but does not want to work with `H,I`.

`B` is not interested in either leadership position and is interested in `n,o,p,q`. 

etc. etc. etc.

Each person will be input with a name, preferences as to leadership positions, various topic interests and specific preferences
about who they would/would not want to work with.

My program would then return the 3 groups that best suit everyone's interests.
