# Project plan

## Language evaluation
_How will you know that your language has accomplished its goals? What tools, techniques, or measurements will you use to evaluate your language design? What tools or practices will you use to ensure that your language implementation is of high quality?_

If I can accurately simulate many simple acid-base reactions, it will have met 
my expectations of this class.  I plan on writing a number of diverse test 
cases that each feature different types of acid-base reactions and will see
which of them it is able to do.  I will maintain high code test coverage, as well
as PEP8 style compliance.  Lastly I will make sure that it stays readable, 
managable, and modular throughout.

## Implementation plan
_How much time do you think you'll need for the various components of your language (e.g., finding a host language, implementing the semantics, the parser, tools, etc)? Provide a brief schedule (e.g., with a deliverable every week) for your project._

I plan on spending the next week working on the dispatch system.  I hope to have the
initial implementation of the reaction dispatch system done.

Then I will work on implementing the test cases - I'm hoping for 5-10 diverse, meaningful
tests that I can look at from start to finish.

Then the acid-base reaction mechanism and the underlying data structures.

The last week will be buffer and polishing time - I think that weeks 1 and 3, in particular,
will be likely to run over time and may not be manageable in the time I've alloted for them.
The last week will allow buffer time to finish these sections, as well as to polish up
whatever I have and prepare for the presentations.
