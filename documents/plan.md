# Project plan

## Language evaluation

There are several compile-time behaviors that I'd
like to implement. But most of all, I want those implementations to be
readable, understandable and maybe even _reproducible_ by other members
of the class. That's the main standard.

If I could get that result on even just unit calculations, I would be
completely happy. If I could get that result on Hindley-Milner, then I would
have made something that was actually useful for teaching people
Hindley-Milner at the very least.

## Implementation plan

Next week, I would like to have something clear enough that my
critique partner's job will not be so hard. :)

I would like to be able to build some kind of unit calculator up-and-running
in the next two weeks.
I would do this using either Haskell, which I think I know how to do,
or Scala's Lightweight Modular Staging, which may be more
ultimately _productive_ to have done it in.
(Of course, the emphasis is on making a tiny framework _with which_ I build
the unit calculator, because just making UniCalc itself
is not really relevant.) The next week, I would like to implement
a simple type system, and then type inference system, using
the same framework, which would certainly require changing that
framework.

After that, it becomes time to figure out whether I'm pushing forward
on this project as is, or the back-up version which is
"How to use compile-time/staging in implementing DSLs."
That would be the moment that having worked a lot with LMS would
become useful.
