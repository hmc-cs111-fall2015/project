# FreeTyle Critique Nov 19
_Robin Pollak_ 

You're doing great! It really seems like you are having a lot of success working through problems. I really admire the way that you have been keeping such a great notebook (it seems like its mostly for you, not for the critiquer which I can really appreciate) and are following through on problems you are having and getting them resolved. I think thats an awesome recipe for a great final project! ðŸ‘Œ

## Comments For You
It seems like you have a really solid idea of where you've been and where you are heading which makes my job both easy and hard (easy because theres not much to comment on, hard because I still want to help!) 

In terms of getting things to run from the command line Alex has done this successfully so I looked through his code and found this [file](https://github.com/hmc-aozdemir/project/blob/master/src/main/scala/construct/input/loader/Loader.scala) that I think is relevant. Hopefully it helps!

You should comment your code! Neither you or alex (or me, i guess) really comment your code and I think we should all start! It'll make it a lot easier for all of us to critique and do code review instead of just discussing things from the notebook.

## Answers I have for you
In regards to shapes you should support I agree that general support for circles is a really hard (read: probably unsolvable) problem for the scope of this project. Freeform shapes (definition of points with lines connecting them) and rectangles are a pretty good place to start but I also think it would be awesome to support hexagons (think [settlers of catan](http://www.profeasy.com/Settlers_Boardgame/assets/images/komplett_M.jpg)) but that might be a hard problem too.

I did have an idea about how you could support circles, though. You could have support for circles that are part of a larger shape. Like, continuing with the example of catan, you could have a circle of grain surrounded by a rectangle of brick. This would allow you to support circles without having to drastically alter your geometry logic.

## Please enjoy this, we all work hard
