The code looks good to me! It's surprisingly well documented too!
Also considering you're at >90% code coverage, I'd say you're off to a great start.
My main complaint is that the provided functions are longer than ideal.
It seems like if we're using the language,
we can assume we're working with reactions,
so we can shorten the names to `register` and `is_registered`?

I'm undecided as to whether to make the language "more general."
I think it's worth talking to some profs from the Chem department
about their current experience with similar software, the effectiveness of your current model,
and whether they foresee wanting to add more expression to the current model.
My main hesitance to making it mroe general is that it would probably require users
to be more verbose about what they want, which might not be worth it
if you're already satisfying most of the users' desires.
