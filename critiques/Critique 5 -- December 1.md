## Notebook

Nice summary of your week. In cases like these, you could describe a challenging bug or list a few of the bugs that you worked on.

For defining time, I wish there could be a way to define whether dates are MM/DD/YYYY or DD/MM/YYYY.
Also, it would be great if people could also write out the weekdays.
Looking at your implmentation, I am not sure how that would work out.

## Project Repository
Typo in your readme:
_"scope these sections to limit the ammount of code written"_
should be:
"scope these sections to limit the amount of code written"

Great description for how to run your code.

Looks like you're ready for the demo!

## Project Documents
Awesome! Not much to say, you seem well on your way. You addressed the bugs you were dealing with already!
Good idea about user testing, you can probably use studio time this Wednesday to deal with that.
