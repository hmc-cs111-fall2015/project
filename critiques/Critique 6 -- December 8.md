## Presentation & Final Critique

It looks like you have everything working the way that you want it.
The Readme is thorough and from your project, I'm really glad you put it into a JAR so that anyone can use it.
You have a short typo in your readme... "ammount" -> "amount"

Great motiviation to start off. Schedules really can be tedious! 
Good overview of specific examples that you want to address (like holidays) and how schedules need to be constrained by semesters, which start on different days.

I like your example, especially working through how a user would take what they want.
I wish it was integrated with cchu's scheduler like you mentioned too :-)
Every semester I use the scheduler, I go "damn I wish this could be exported to gCal".

I think you could have expanded on how you would go about improving your language. or even just things you are unhappy with.
Maybe someone else can pick up this project and address those needs.
However, I think if this language is just meant to be an intermediary between other languages (like gCal and some GUI), then you are alright!
