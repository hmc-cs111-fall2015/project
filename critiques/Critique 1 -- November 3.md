This looks like an extremely cool and useful project, and your writeup was very
understandable. You were worried about the chemistry details being too
complicated but I thought you abstracted them out well enough that I could
understand what was going on (although not the examples).

You talked about the dispatch system a lot, and I'm not sure I'm fully seeing
the importance of it. From my understanding, users will be able to specify
how certain types of chemicals react (like things with hydrogens attached to
carbons interact with things with hydrogens attached to oxygens in this way). Is
your dispatch system going to dispatch on this, rather than on types? If this is
the case, I don't think it matters too much how the dispatch is done, since the
cost of performing the calculations to figure out if a function is applicable to
a problem will far outweigh the cost of any dispatch system you have. Your
method for specifying things seems very solid and I can't think of anything that
would be better.
