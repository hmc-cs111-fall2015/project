This idea seems really cool. In particular, I'm drawn by the concept
of users of a language being able to embed their own syntax in the language
for the purpose of morphing the code they've written into some other form
before being compiled (which is actually just the proposed project itself?).
It seems similar to Scala in that the language could give users
the ability to create their own syntax that is translated to another language:
they choose the syntax in which they want to work,
and let the computer do the necessary translating into an 'actual' language.
And _that_, I suppose, is really part of the intent of high level languages:
to make programming easier. At that, it seems like you want to create a tool
that sort of allows users to build a language on top of existing languages.

Although I like the idea you've proposed, it definitely seems very big, broad,
and like it would be difficult to establish a good model for the language;
but maybe just developing what seems like _would_ be a good model for the language
would be considered sufficient work for the class.
Unit conversion at the descriibed level, on the other hand,
seems like a more traditional and 'understandably' sized project.
