_I think this is a great start._

## Project Plan Critique

For your plan, I think the next step is to flesh out your quantitative metrics. 
For your first metric, not just how many but also what size each feature is would be helpful. (If you have used pivotal tracker, this is similar to the number of points that each feature or story receives)
Feel is a difficult metric to follow, I think this is a great way to personally gauge your progress but maybe find a more concrete metric. I think "feel" is more of an abstraction of the first and third metric than a metric on its own.
Finding external critiques to also be a way to measure your progress is a great idea! You note that it is subjective, and I agree but social sciences and user surveys could help!

Since your project is going to about implementing a front-end and then expanding by going into different kinds of back-end outputs I think your first metric is right on the money. This is going to capture how affective you are. I would be cautious of gauging your goal here too high (or maybe too low, it depends on you) since figuring out how long things will take is a really hard problem (NP-hard??)

I like your implementation plan and leaving a buffer time for polish. I think it would also help to include evaluation time. We have a prototype, but maybe another checkpoint for your project to say "Here is where I absolutely should be, and here I am now." For your Nov. 22nd deadline, how are you prioritizing? (Essential vs. *really nice*). It is implied that essential comes first, but make sure this is all clear in the plan documentation!

## Project description critique

Love the ever present hipster! :-)

You describe automated drink production as your domain, but who are the users? Are they recipe makers? Are they at-home baristas? Is it Starbucks converting their workforce to robots?
Very neat that other languages do not exist. Although, I think the "drink maker" in the Hoch Shanahan could be a _crude_ example of a DSL in the automated coffee making domain.
The more I think about it, I am sure there are some proprietary manufacturing systems that have a language for the mass-produced drinks (a-la bottled Starbucks frappes). It is too bad that we cannot see them, because maybe they need this language as well!


We chatted briefly about this in class, but a useful data structure may be objects that represent different drinks. (Decorater Design Pattern anyone?) Scala may have a built in decorator... And this could lend itself to an ingredients list as a useful output. (Online ordering back-end??)
Awesome that you are keeping your design choices open... but your project plan has design plans completed within the first week! :-) 

In your example computations, you mention a language design choice of weights vs. percentages... why not both! I think the language should be a fluid switch for people of that domain, baristas here. So if they are used to oz or pumps, then so be it, the intermediate representation can deal with the specifics.

You have a readme! :-)
